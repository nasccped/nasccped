<summary><strong>Top 🥇: Kojamp Man</strong></summary>

**Kojamp Man** is a **Kotlin** and **Java** Project Manager (like
[Gradle][gradle-link]) but a _'noob'_ version of it. While Gradle and
[Maven][maven-link] generates a giant environment to compile, run and
debug the project, Kojamp Man just generates the basic content
(`.git/`, `src/`, `Makefile`) to you develope and run your project as
an academic one or something related.

You can get more info about at the
[official github repository][kojamp-man-link]

<!-- gptheme plus -->
<details>

<summary><strong>Top 🥈: GPTheme Plus for VS Code</strong></summary>

**GPTheme Plus** for VS Code is a VS Code colorscheme based on
[Chat GPT][chat-gpt-link] code view. It's not a big achievement, but
I was proud of it.

You can get more info about at the
[official github repository][gptheme-plus-github-link] or you can go
to [vscode marketplace][gptheme-plus-mrktplc-link] too...
