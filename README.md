Experiences
-----------

I've never been in a real world job. I only have academic/personal
experience. I've already had contact with the following technologies:

- **`Python 🐍`** was my first programming language ever. I really
                  liked it, but it was a bit oversaturated

- **`PHP 🐘`** a good server-side language. Not a big fan of it, but it
               does what it promises

- **`SQL 🗂️`** I've used it to build some academic exercises

- **`Web-Dev 🌐`** I mean HTML, CSS and JS (not libs/frameworks yet)

- **`Git 🏷️`** Big fan of this guy 👈

- **`C/H Lang ⚙️`** My most _'hands on'_ language. There's a lot of
                   bugs segmentation faults, etc. But it's still a
                   greate language at all

- **`Java ☕`** I don't understand why everyone hates this language.
                It's a lot verbose, but does exactly what it promises
                and much more. A great language at all

- **`Others Not So Important`**
