programming is so much cooler than it seems! <img

<details>

<summary><strong>Top 🥇: Kojamp Man 📦</strong></summary><br>

**Kojamp Man** is a **Kotlin 🏝️** and **Java ☕** Project Manager (like
[Gradle 🐘][gradle-link]) in a _'noob'_ version. While Gradle and
[Maven 🪶][maven-link] generates a giant environment to compile, run
and debug the project, Kojamp Man just generates the basic content
(`.git/`, `src/`, `Makefile`) to develope and run your project as
an academic one or something related 🏫

The project is currently at the beggining and receiving updates time
by time. You can get more info at the
[official github repository 🔗][kojamp-man-link]

</details>

<!-- gptheme plus -->
<details>

<summary><strong>Top 🥈: GPTheme Plus for VS Code 🎨</strong></summary><br>

**GPTheme Plus for VS Code** is a VS Code colorscheme extension based
on [Chat GPT][chat-gpt-link] code view. It's not a big achievement,
but I was proud of it 🫡

A short while ago, I started using [Neovim][neovim-link] as my **IDE**
and this made me work less on this project 🙁, but you can still get
more information by accessing the
[official github repository 👥][gptheme-plus-github-link] or the
[vscode marketplace 🛒][gptheme-plus-mrktplc-link] too...

<!-- tic tac low -->
<details>

<summary><strong>Top 🥉: Tic Tac Low 🕹️</strong></summary><br>

**Tic Tac Low** is a self-challenge game proposal inspired on the
`Tic Tac Toe` _(My first solo game developed at CS school)_. Read until
the end. It Worth 🥹

At first, I wanted to develop a game, but with some restrictions:

- Make a game in _Pygame_, _Java_, _Unreal_, _..._ it's easy a lot 💤.
Dude, I'm not a _programmer_ 👶, I'm a _**PRO**-grammer_ 🗿. I want to
do this **in the hardest lang that I've learned**. _(C was choosen
<img src="./assets/random-guy_at_war.gif"
style="height: 1rem; widht: 2rem"
alt="goofy war meme">)_
- **Libs**? **Generate window**? **Dependencies**? The only
dependency here will be the **binary**. The rest will be coded 🗿
- Everything will be **visualized** and **accessed** by the terminal
window. The game **is simple**, the implementation **is hard**.
That's the deal 🗿

---

So... **what's the problem? 🤓**

When I started the [Kojamp Man 📦][kojamp-man-link] development, I
ended up _leaving this project aside for a while_ ~~(the difficulty
in development also contributed)~~. I don't know if I'll go back to
developing this project any time soon, but I **intend to finish it
someday!** <img src="./assets/random-theres_a_starman.png"

to **get in touch?** All types of contact **are welcome!** 😄

Don't know how? Don't worry, I'll give you the step-by-step:

- **About the social media**, I'm not gonna lie. I'm not active at
all but you can get my **Youtube channel**, **LinkedIn** and
**Reddit** profile at my [github home page][github-profile-link].
_(english only <img src="./assets/random-no_something_meme.jpg"

aren't at README.md)_ and access the links that are below/by side the
