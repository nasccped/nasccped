<!-- description text ---------------------------------------------->
I am currently studying the **Computer Science** course at the
[Cruzeiro do Sul <img
src="./assets/logo-cruzeiro_do_sul.png"
style="height: 1rem"
alt="Cruzeiro do Sul logo">][cruzeiro-do-sul-link] university. I
started it in 2023 and I discovered that programming is so much
cooler than it seems! <img

Me, my skills & more
--------------------

I'm **CS** student 📚. I don't have a profissional experience, but I'm
extremely interested in the area and believe I have strong
potential 🔭

Now talking about my skills, I'll try to mention them all, even if
they're kind of obvious:

<details>

<summary><strong>Hard skills 👷‍♂️</strong></summary><br>

- **Algorithms practices:** by learning programming, obviously I
learned how to structure an algorithm, its procedures, performing and
_'prettyness'_ of it 🔁
- **Data structure:** I've learned how to create, use and manipulate
different data types, _primitive ones_ (chars, numerics), _complex_
(arrays, list, linked list, stacks) and I'm still _learning others_
(binary tree, binary search tree, etc) 🧑‍🔬
- **Low level concept:** at **CS College**, I've learned a bunch of
concepts aplieds to [C lang][c-lang-link], such as pointers &
references, memory allocation ( <img src="./assets/random-skull.png"
style="height: 1rem" alt="dude"> 👈 by the way), **C** files and
**Header** files
- **Databases:** Relational database was learned too ([MySQL 🐬
only][mysql-link]), his concept and uses
- **OOP paradigm:** object-oriented programming and his concepts
(classes, objects, methods, attributes, inheritance, abstraction,
etc.) has been learned 🐕 (it was learned using [Java][java-link]
but works in any OOP Lang xD)
- **Web development and server integration:** I've learned a lil' bit
about vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm not a big fan of it but I
have a good idea of how they work 🌐. Also, learned how to integrate a
_'server-kind'_ to web pages using MySQL, PHP and a Apache, XAMPP
WampServer (☝️ this guy don't like web but want to learn a framework)
- **Versioning practices:** versioning projects during the
development it's one of the most important tasks to turn into a good
programmer. I have a good understanding about versioning 🏷️,
colaborating 🫂 and similars.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Soft skills 🧠</strong></summary><br>

- **Analytical/critical thinking:** skill developed almost
automatically when we study programming, also, very important to
problem solving. 🎯
- **Self-didaction & constant learning:** When it comes to
technology, all the information we need is available on the internet.
Knowing how to make the most of it is essential to becoming a
successful programmer! 🧑‍💻
- **Problem Solving:** previously mentioned, problem solving is
basically the reason the programmer exists. Little time is spent
building new things but a lot is spent repairing the old ones. 🕰️
- **Comunication:** Regardless of the area in which you work, you
will only be able to be a good professional if you are able to
create, explain and support your ideas and arguments. Knowing how to
convince others through communication proves a lot about your
potential. 🗿

<!-- dedicated to my personal projects ----------------------------->
My top-tier projects
--------------------

<!-- details from projects table -->
In this section, you will find the projects that I'm **most proud
of/consider important**.

<!-- kojamp man -->
<details>

<summary><strong>Top 🥇: Kojamp Man 📦</strong></summary><br>

**Kojamp Man** is a **Kotlin 🏝️** and **Java ☕** Project Manager (like
[Gradle 🐘][gradle-link]) in a _'noob'_ version. While Gradle and
[Maven 🪶][maven-link] generates a giant environment to compile, run
and debug the project, Kojamp Man just generates the basic content
(`.git/`, `src/`, `Makefile`) to develope and run your project as
an academic one or something related 🏫

The project is currently at the beggining and receiving updates time
by time. You can get more info at the
[official github repository 🔗][kojamp-man-link]

</details>

<!-- gptheme plus -->
<details>

<summary><strong>Top 🥈: GPTheme Plus for VS Code 🎨</strong></summary><br>

**GPTheme Plus for VS Code** is a VS Code colorscheme extension based
on [Chat GPT][chat-gpt-link] code view. It's not a big achievement,
but I was proud of it 🫡

A short while ago, I started using [Neovim][neovim-link] as my **IDE**
and this made me work less on this project 🙁, but you can still get
more information by accessing the
[official github repository 👥][gptheme-plus-github-link] or the
[vscode marketplace 🛒][gptheme-plus-mrktplc-link] too...

</details>

<!-- tic tac low -->
<details>

<summary><strong>Top 🥉: Tic Tac Low 🕹️</strong></summary><br>

**Tic Tac Low** is a self-challenge game proposal inspired on the
`Tic Tac Toe` _(My first solo game developed at CS school)_. Read until
the end. It Worth 🥹

At first, I wanted to develop a game, but with some restrictions:

- Make a game in _Pygame_, _Java_, _Unreal_, _..._ it's easy a lot 💤.
Dude, I'm not a _programmer_ 👶, I'm a _**PRO**-grammer_ 🗿. I want to
do this **in the hardest lang that I've learned**. _(C was choosen
<img src="./assets/random-guy_at_war.gif"
style="height: 1rem; widht: 2rem"
alt="goofy war meme">)_
- **Libs**? **Generate window**? **Dependencies**? The only
dependency here will be the **binary**. The rest will be coded 🗿
- Everything will be **visualized** and **accessed** by the terminal
window. The game **is simple**, the implementation **is hard**.
That's the deal 🗿

So... **what's the problem? 🤓**

When I started the [Kojamp Man 📦][kojamp-man-link] development, I
ended up _leaving this project aside for a while_ ~~(the difficulty
in development also contributed)~~. I don't know if I'll go back to
developing this project any time soon, but I **intend to finish it
someday!** <img src="./assets/random-theres_a_starman.png"
style="height: 1rem; width: 2rem"
