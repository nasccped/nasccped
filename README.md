<!-- about me section -->
I'm nasccped, a **Computer Science student** at
[Cruzeiro do Sul][cruzeiro-do-sul-link] ⭐

I like **programming** and **development** in general and I'm also
currently learning `Java ☕`, `C lang 📠` and `Script kind 📋` to
develop my personal projects ([tic tac toe game][tic-tac-low-repo] &
[project manager][kojamp-man-repo]).

I also had contact with other technologies such as:
- `Python`
- `HTML` | `CSS` | `JS`
- `PHP`
- `MySQL`
- `Git` _(a lot)_
- `Kotlin`
