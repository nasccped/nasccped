My Configs for Bash Terminal
============================

Here is my Bash Terminal configurations!

Clone repo and move files can be borigin a lot, so you can just
**copy** and **paste** instead.

All necessary content will be disposed at `src/.bashrc`. Just copy
it to your local `.bashrc` (probably located in your _home/USERNAME_
path). [`git` program][git-link] will be necessary!
